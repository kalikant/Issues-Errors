0. Error:
org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: java.io.IOException: java.io.IOException: Filesystem closed
Solution: Add below 2 in .hql
set fs.hdfs.impl.disable.cache=false;
set fs.file.impl.disable.cache=false; 
 
1. show create table not working: 
Authorization failed:No privilege 'Select' found for inputs { database:database_xxxx, table:table_abc}. 
Use SHOW GRANT to get more details.

Solution: set hive.security.authorization.enabled=false;
try again !

2. CONCAT_WS function is not working: 
CONCAT_WS function must be "string or array<string>", but "int" was found

Solution: Create table with column as string type for which this function is used.
Note: But we can pass int as STRING TYPE to get it work


3. Trim arguments sn/b of TYPE ->DATE or Decimal: 
Wrong arguments 'dateofbirth': trim takes only STRING/CHAR/VARCHAR types Found DATE. 
Wrong arguments 'amt': trim takes only STRING/CHAR/VARCHAR types. Found DECIMAL
Note: But we can pass DATE/DECIMAL as STRING TYPE to get it work

4. Select * & Count(*) Mismatch (queries shows count even after drop table)
‘Select *’ is not showing anything, however ‘Select count(*)’ is giving some value:
hive> select count(*) from database_xxxx.table_abc;
3121

Solution:
hive> SET hive.compute.query.using.stats=FALSE;
hive> select count(*) from database_xxxx.table_abc;   
0

5. Wrong result for count(*) in hive table                                                                                                                                             
Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24080276/wrong-result-for-count-in-hive-table
count(*) is not giving the correct result, while the actual number of rows in table is different             
Reason: I found this issue in count(*) if We are inserting into a table more than once. 
Tables created with single insert soesn't raise any issue mutliple insert lead to inconsistent row count .

Solution 1: 
Internal table - drop n recreate the table, and insert into the table again then select count(*) will be incorrect. 
External table - remove all the files in HDFS, and insert into the table again then select count(*) will be incorrect. 
Solution 2:          
ANALYZE TABLE table_abc PARTITION(day) COMPUTE STATISTICS;


6. Index creation failed in Tez:
CREATE TABLE table02 (column1 String, column2 bigint, column3 string); 
CREATE INDEX table02_index ON TABLE table02 (column3) AS 'COMPACT' WITH DEFERRED REBUILD; 
FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask. Indexes unsupported for Tez execution engine
ALTER INDEX table02_index ON table02 REBUILD;

Solution:
set hive.execution.engine=mr;
hive> CREATE INDEX table02_index ON TABLE table02 (column3) AS 'COMPACT' WITH DEFERRED REBUILD;

So, for index creation on a table, we always have to set hive.execution.engine=mr 
even if we want to use TEZ to perform queries on the data in that table? Is it limitation for TEZ?

7. Normal query is working but functions are not working:
   FAILED: DAG submit failed due to There is conflicting local resource. 
   (I think resource could be function or dependent data as well)

WorkAround:
Check whether function used in query is there in Hive or not.
show functions;

Solution:
set hive.llap.execution.mode=auto;

8. Error:
Input path does not exist: Or (below message on msck repair)
Partitions missing from filesystem:
Solution:
Drop and re-create the table

9.  IndexOutOfBoundsException Error while running query in Tez
Solution: 
upgrade to Hive 1.4 or greater
Workaround:  
Run the query without Partition pruning:
set hive.tez.dynamic.partition.pruning=false;
