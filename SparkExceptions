Increase the Spark executor Memory. If running in Yarn, its recommended to increase the overhead memory as well to avoid OOM issues.
Overhead memory is used for JVM threads, internal metadata etc. The following setting is captured as part of the spark-submit or 
in the spark-defaults.conf file
 
--conf “spark.executor.memory=12g”
--conf “spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead=2048”
or
-- "executor-memory=12g"
